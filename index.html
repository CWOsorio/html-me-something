       <p>DIY crafting is an activity that I have always loved even before I started doing it myself. I've
           always enjoyed looking at the creations that other crafters have come up with. I always enjoyed 
           going to craft shows or watching any type of DIY show on television. Eventually I found myself saying 
           more often "hey, I can do that"! So, I did!</p>
           <p>My kiddos had the pleasure of being my first "models". I would design shirts for them all of the time. It
              was really exciting when they starting coming up with their own ideas. They would be elated when their shirts 
              were completed with thier ideas. My daughter came up with the wording for her last day of kindergarten shirt. 
              All of the verbiage that we would see for end of the school year, had a bit of a "good riddance" tone to
              it and that didn't fit her true feels. She loved everything about kindergarten and was sad to leave. Here 
              she is wearing her shirt with her own words.<br> <img = src="images/Last day of School Shirt.jpg"

           </p>
           <p>Then I started with paper crafting and making cute little shadow boxes with rolled paper flowers 
              inside.<br><img src="images/Rolled Flower.jpg"class="thumbnail" height="100" width="100"/> <br>   From there I transistioned to creating hair bows for my daughter and making fun personalized shirts for them.</p>
           <p>My latest creations are all about sparkle and shine! It's a tideous yet relaxing process for a beautiful 
              outcome. I started small by in corporating rhinestones into the center of the paper flowers that I would
            make and now my goal is to complete and entire cup with rhinestones. My first completed bling project popsocket. 
            <br><img src="images/Bling Pop Socket.jpg"class="thumbnail" height="100" width="100"/> <br>I'm excited about expanding my skills 
            and can't wait to complete my first cup.</p>
         <p>There are so many crafters that I follow that have inspired my ideas. Since I have been into sparkle lately
            I have been following a crafter who calls herself the Crystal Ninja. Her work is impecable. She is an award 
            winning artist who has spread sparkle all over the world.

               just for fun or it can even become a lucritive business like it has for the Crystal Ninja. Now I'm off to finish crystalizing
